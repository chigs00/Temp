ðŸ§© What Bus Out Does

Puzzleâ€‘jam style: gridlocked vehicles, color matched passenger queues, exit planning  

Adds difficulty: more vehicles, hidden colors, booster powerâ€‘ups like Sort, Shuffle, VIP  

Proven NPâ€‘complete complexity results: finite parking spots, color matching and queue decisions  

ðŸ›  Algorithmic Approaches You Can Use
1. Level graph + block placement

Define connectivity graph (which exits, which blocks) and use configuration spaces to place blocks automaticallyâ€”supports diverse layouts from same template

2. Difficulty tuning rules

Increase grid size, add more blocking vehicles, reduce free spots, hide colors, limit moves or use special features like boosters gradually  

3. Solverâ€‘guided validation

Use pathfinding (like A*) or search methods to test solvability and minimum moves; ensure each generated level has at least one solution (optionally with target move count)  

4. Procedural + ML hybrid

Combine procedural generation (random layouts) with reinforcement learning or neural approaches to prune unsolvable or repetitive layouts; ensures variation but keeps difficulty balanced  

âš™ Workflow: Short Steps

define-level-template()
generate-grid(layout params)
place vehicles and define queue
check solvability with solver/test
if failure â†’ regenerate/shuffle
tune difficulty via vehicle density/hidden colors/power-ups
final test and export

Example flow:

Levelâ€‘1: small grid, few vehicles, fully visible colors, no boosters.

Gradually add: more vehicles, color hidden, limited parking spots, require use of powerâ€‘ups.

Solver ensures level is solvable in â‰¤â€¯X moves.

Automatically generate variants by shuffling layout while respecting rules.

ðŸŽ¥ Example walkthrough

Shows how later levels stack complexity: more blockers, hidden elements, careful planning.

âœ… Short advice:

Use graph/block layout algorithms for variety.

Always test solvability via A* or search.

Ramp difficulty by increasing constraints.

Optionally use ML to refine level generation.

Not at all bro, Here's the simple breakdown:

ðŸŒ€ Radial Grid Basics

1. Divide Circle â†’ into equal slots (like pizza slices):

angle = 360 / slots_per_ring

2. Each bus = sits on:

ring_index (distance from center)
slot_index (angle position)

3. Get X, Y position:

x = center_x + radius * cos(angle_in_radians)
y = center_y + radius * sin(angle_in_radians)

> radius = ring_index * ring_spacing
angle_in_radians = slot_index * angle * (Ï€ / 180)


ðŸšŒ Move Logic

Rotate: slot_index += 1 or -1

Move In/Out: ring_index += 1 or -1

Done! You now have:

Bus positions

Movement logic

Level structure
